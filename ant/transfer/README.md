# PyTorch implementation of TRPO

Try my implementation of [PPO](github.com/ikostrikov/pytorch-a2c-ppo-acktr/) (aka newer better variant of TRPO), unless you need to you TRPO for some specific reasons.

## Resource

The code is originated from the [TRPO repository](https://github.com/ikostrikov/pytorch-trpo).

## Usage

The running commands for the relaxing stage, the barrier set size method and the reward weight method, and the code to compute iterations are shown in 'curriculum.sh'.
